# Getting Started with Alpine.js

Alpine.js is a lightweight JavaScript framework that makes it easy to add interactivity to your HTML. Here's how to get started with this powerful tool.

## What is Alpine.js?

Alpine.js is a minimal framework that provides reactive and declarative behavior to your HTML. It's perfect for:

- Simple interactive components
- Form handling
- Toggle states
- Data binding
- DOM manipulation

## Basic Syntax

Getting started is straightforward:

```html
<div x-data="{ open: false }">
    <button @click="open = !open">Toggle</button>
    <div x-show="open">Content here!</div>
</div>
```

## Key Directives

### x-data
Defines the component's data scope:

```html
<div x-data="{ count: 0 }">
    <span x-text="count"></span>
    <button @click="count++">Increment</button>
</div>
```

### x-show and x-if
Control element visibility:

```html
<div x-show="isVisible">Shown when isVisible is true</div>
<template x-if="condition">
    <div>Only rendered when condition is true</div>
</template>
```

### Event Handling
Respond to user interactions:

```html
<button @click="handleClick()">Click me</button>
<input @input="search = $event.target.value">
```

## Integration with Statamic

Alpine.js works seamlessly with Statamic:

- No build process required
- Works with Antlers templating
- Perfect for dynamic filtering and sorting
- Easy to implement search functionality

## Best Practices

1. **Keep it simple**: Alpine.js is for simple interactions
2. **Use meaningful names**: Make your data properties descriptive
3. **Organize your code**: Group related functionality
4. **Test thoroughly**: Ensure your interactions work as expected

Alpine.js is the perfect choice when you need just a little bit of JavaScript magic without the complexity of larger frameworks.
