# Performance Optimization Strategies for Modern Websites

In today's digital landscape, website performance is more critical than ever. Users expect fast, responsive experiences, and search engines prioritize speed in their rankings.

## Core Web Vitals Matter

Google's Core Web Vitals are now ranking factors. Focus on:
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: Aim for under 2.5 seconds
- **First Input Delay (FID)**: Keep under 100ms
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: Maintain under 0.1

## Image Optimization Techniques

### 1. Use Modern Formats
WebP and AVIF provide superior compression while maintaining quality. Always provide fallbacks for older browsers.

### 2. Implement Lazy Loading
Load images only when they're about to enter the viewport. This significantly reduces initial page load times.

### 3. Responsive Images
Serve appropriately sized images based on device capabilities and screen size.

## JavaScript Optimization

### Bundle Splitting
Split your JavaScript into smaller chunks that can be loaded on demand. This reduces the initial bundle size.

### Tree Shaking
Remove unused code from your bundles. Modern bundlers can eliminate dead code automatically.

### Code Splitting
Load JavaScript modules only when needed, reducing the initial payload.

## CSS Optimization

### Critical CSS
Inline critical CSS and defer non-critical styles. This improves First Contentful Paint.

### Purge Unused CSS
Remove unused CSS classes, especially when using utility-first frameworks like Tailwind CSS.

## Server-Side Optimizations

### Caching Strategies
Implement proper caching headers and use CDNs for static assets.

### Database Optimization
Optimize database queries and consider using query caching for frequently accessed data.

### Server Response Times
Aim for server response times under 200ms for optimal user experience.

## Monitoring and Testing

Regular performance audits using tools like:
- Google PageSpeed Insights
- WebPageTest
- Lighthouse
- GTmetrix

Remember, performance optimization is an ongoing process. Regularly monitor your site's performance and make improvements based on real user data.
