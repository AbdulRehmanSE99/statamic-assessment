Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness (E-A-T) are crucial factors:

- Create comprehensive, well-researched content
- Establish author credentials and expertise
- Build trust through transparent practices

## Technical SEO Fundamentals

Don't overlook the basics:

- Proper meta tags and structured data
- Clean URL structure
