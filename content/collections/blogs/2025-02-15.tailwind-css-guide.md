# Mastering Tailwind CSS in 2025

Tailwind CSS has revolutionized how we approach web styling. Here's your comprehensive guide to mastering this utility-first framework.

## Why Tailwind CSS?

Tailwind CSS offers several advantages:

- **Rapid Development**: Build interfaces faster with utility classes
- **Consistency**: Predefined design system ensures consistency
- **Responsive Design**: Built-in responsive utilities
- **Customization**: Easy to customize to your brand
- **Performance**: Only includes the CSS you use

## Core Concepts

### Utility-First Approach

Instead of writing custom CSS, you compose designs using utility classes:

```html
<div class="bg-blue-500 text-white p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Card Title</h2>
  <p class="text-sm opacity-90">Card content goes here</p>
</div>
```

### Responsive Design

Tailwind makes responsive design simple:

```html
<div class="w-full md:w-1/2 lg:w-1/3 p-4">
  <!-- Content that adapts to screen size -->
</div>
```

## Essential Utilities

### Spacing
- `p-4` (padding), `m-2` (margin)
- `px-6` (horizontal), `py-3` (vertical)
- `space-x-4` (gap between children)

### Colors
- `bg-blue-500`, `text-gray-700`
- `border-red-300`, `hover:bg-green-600`

### Typography
- `text-sm`, `text-lg`, `font-bold`
- `text-center`, `leading-relaxed`

### Layout
- `flex`, `grid`, `hidden`
- `justify-between`, `items-center`

## Best Practices

1. **Component Extraction**: Create reusable components for repeated patterns
2. **Consistent Spacing**: Use the spacing scale consistently
3. **Mobile First**: Start with mobile and scale up
4. **Semantic HTML**: Don't sacrifice semantics for styling

## Integration with Statamic

Tailwind CSS works perfectly with Statamic:

- Easy to configure with your brand colors
- Works seamlessly with Antlers templating
- Can be customized per project needs
- Excellent for building custom control panel themes

## Advanced Techniques

### Custom Components
Extract common patterns into components:

```html
<!-- Button component -->
<button class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-600 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded">
  Click me
</button>
```

### Dark Mode
Tailwind's dark mode support:

```html
<div class="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 text-gray-900 dark:text-white">
  <!-- Content that adapts to dark mode -->
</div>
```

Mastering Tailwind CSS will significantly improve your development workflow and create more consistent, maintainable designs.
